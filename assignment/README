The proposal for my app
	this is my proposal about my app, I talked about the presentation for my app inside class,
  I plan to do a problem-solving app linked to university students inside school. 
  
	About my app, I am thinking about put a log in page in the first part of my app.
  The log in page can make specific user to log in to the system, this is the first 
  thing inside my app, after that, I plan to add two links in the first page, the 
  first link is the question-and-answer page, the second link is about the events will happens in school.
  
	For the first link inside the main page, which is the main function about my app, 
  the question-and-answer page. After users log into the system, and press this link, 
  they can see a lot of questions posted by other users, and the user can also see a “+”
  link in the corner, this mark can make the user to post some questions inside the question
  page, and after the user click every question, they can see those questions and answer 
  those questions. I do not plan to add locker to those questions; thus, all the users can 
  see all the questions inside the app. This is the first part about my app.
	For the second link inside the main page, I plan to add the part about new events inside 
  school, for example, the user can see events that will happens inside school, this page can 
  improve the using experience about the users, it makes this app not only answers those questions,
  after user saw those events, they can also put their question in the question part.
	
  Those are the proposal about my app, this app is also a challenge to me, but I will do my best on the app!
