The problem the project attempts to solve is user to post questions and user can 
also post some comments under the questions. The reason why I choose it is because 
user can see those questions on the app directly. 

The way how this app could be installation is that, it is a android project, thus,
it can be installed on all android phone by using the .apk file. Another way is to 
download the source files from the git hub page of the project. we can also use the
android studio to run the program by using the virtual machine. 


This is how to use the app. First, put in the username and the password. Then press 
REGISTER, after register the account. We can log in. press QUESTION.  We can type 
questions on the first line. And press the mark “+” we can post our questions on the
page. After click the questions we posted, we can add comments under those questions
(by using the mark “+” under each questions page.)
